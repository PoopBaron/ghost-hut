Clean theme for the Ghost Blogging Platform.

**I have made some changes to the commenting system for posts**

Take note at the bottom of post.hbs where the final section tag is, and you will see the Disqus code snippet.  Just add your shortname where I have instructed and you will be good to go for commenting.  I tried a few commenting options and Disqus *unfortunately* wins for least shitty solution.

Make sure to change Google Analytics in default.hbs
